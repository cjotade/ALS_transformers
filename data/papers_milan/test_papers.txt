 This work a formal connection between density estimation with a data rate constraint and the joint objective of fixed rate universal source and model identification by in TIT , , , . an equivalent learning formulation , we derive a necessary and sufficient condition over the class of for the of the joint objective . The learning framework used here is the skeleton estimator , a rate constrained learning scheme that achievable for the joint and modeling problem by its learning to the specific of the problem . The with the skeleton estimator significantly extend the context where universal source and model identification can be , for that move from the known case of parametric collection of with some smoothness and to the rich family of non parametric L totally bounded . In addition , in the parametric case we are able to remove one of the that constrain the applicability of the original result similar in of the distortion redundancy and per letter rate overhead . : fixed rate source ; joint and modeling ; universal source ; learning with rate ; the skeleton estimator ; L totally bounded classes Universal source a long history in information theory and statistics . seminal work the variable length lossless problem and important information for performance analysis , . In this lossless setting , it is well understood that the entropy the minimum achievable rate in per sample to code a stationary and memoryless source when the probability model of the source is available . When the probability of the source is not known but to a family of the so universal source problem , the focus of the problem is to characterize the penalty or redundancy in per sample that an and pair will experience due to the lack of knowledge about the probability . In the lossless case , a seminal result that the least worst case redundancy over or the solution of the problem for is determined by the information radius of . Building on this connection between least worse case redundancy and information radius of , there are numerous important for lossless , . In particular , it is known that the information radius sub linearly with the block length for the family of finite alphabet stationary and memoryless , which the existence of a universal source code that entropy as the block length goes to a large value for every distribution in . However universality is not possible for the family of alphabet stationary and memoryless because the information radius of this family is unbounded , , . More recent on lossless over countable infinite have at the analysis to specific of with some tail bounded to achieve universality and also at weak of the lossless source setting . In the fixed rate source problem , assuming first that the probability of a memoryless source is known , the performance limit of the problem is given by the distortion rate function , . Consequently , the universal source problem to compare the distortion of a scheme satisfying a fixed rate constraint with the distortion rate function assuming that the designer only that . The literature on this problem is rich , , with a first result dating back to who the existence of weakly fixed rate universal source code for the class of stationary under certain about the source , the alphabet , and the distortion measure . More refined were in , one of which established necessary and sufficient to achieve weakly universality for the class of stationary and ergodic . To provide a more specific analysis of universal source , Linder al . a scheme with a distortion redundancy that goes to zero as O for the case of independent and identically distributed i . i .. bound . Later Linder al . previous showing a fixed rate construction with a distortion redundancy that as O log and O log finite alphabet i . i .. and bounded infinite alphabet i . i . respectively . Similar convergence were a nearest neighbor vector quantization approach in . It is also understood that universal variable length lossless source is connected with the problem of distribution estimation , , as there is a one to one correspondence between prefix free and finite entropy discrete in the finite and countable alphabet case , , . Building on this one to one correspondence in the lossless case , al . , Theorem that the redundancy in per sample of a given code upper the divergence between the true distribution of the source and the distribution derived from the code . Therefore , the existence of a universal lossless source code existence of a universal distribution free in estimator of the distribution in direct information divergence . This that lossless not only a lossless representation of the data , but it a consistent error free estimator of the distribution at the receiver . The connection between and distribution estimation that is evident in the lossless case is not , however , present in the fixed rate source problem . As in , a fixed rate source code does not offer a direct map with a probability distribution model for the source . In light of this gap between and and by some in adaptive control , where it is relevant to both compress data in a way and identify the distribution of the source at the receiver , , the joint objective of fixed rate universal source and model i . e ., distribution identification in . Inspired by construction in , , a new setting for the problem of fixed rate universal compression of continuous memoryless based on the idea of a two stage joint and model or distribution identification framework . In this context , he a two stage scheme to consider two : fixed rate universal source and source distribution model identification . The first objective of the scheme is to transmit the data in the classical distortion rate sense , while the second objective is to learn and transmit a description version of the source distribution model , . Taking from statistical learning , splitting the data into training and testing . The training data is used in the first stage of the process to construct a estimation of the source distribution and encode it the first stage . Then in a second stage of the process , the first stage are used to pick a with the distribution fixed rate source code to encode the test data the second stage . In this joint and modeling setting , the existence of a zero rate consistent estimator of the density in total variation is sufficient to show the existence of a weakly universal fixed rate source scheme Theorem . , the distortion rate function , , , , for any given rate . This result is for a wide class of single letter bounded distortion and for a family of source : indexed over a bounded finite dimensional space , i . e ., a parametric collection with some smoothness and Theorem . . It is important to highlight that the joint and modeling in did not degrade the performance of the source objective . In fact by the analysis to the source objective alone , the joint and modeling framework in the same state of the art performance as conventional two stage universal source or universal vector , , in of distortion redundancy and per letter rate overhead O and O log , respectively as the block a large number . Importantly , the first stage of this joint and modeling scheme are used to achieve model identification at the receiver with arbitrary precision in total variation with a rate of convergence of O to infinity , with no extra cost in per letter with conventional fixed rate source . This work formally the interplay between density estimation under a data rate constraint and the joint fixed rate universal source and modeling problem with training data or memory in . The first main result Theorem a connection between zero rate density estimation and a universal joint and modeling scheme that optimal source in a distortion rate sense and lossless model identification . This result is for the general family of bounded single letter . Remarkably , this connection that the construction of a joint and modeling scheme to the construction of a zero rate density estimator . From this result , the second main result Theorem a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a weakly universal joint and modeling scheme . For the part of this result , we used the skeleton estimator as our learning framework . this learning framework we extend the parametric context in to the rich non parametric scenario of L totally bounded . Furthermore , the parametric case studied in , by the skeleton estimator we are able to remove some of the that limit the applicability of the original result . We show that the skeleton estimator the best performance in in of the distortion redundancy and per letter rate overhead , in particular of convergence to zero of O and O log , respectively , as the block length to infinity . To obtain this , our result the finite and dimension assumption considered in . On the other hand , when the finite dimension assumption is added in the analysis , the skeleton learning scheme a convergence rate of O for the distortion redundancy as the sample length goes to infinity . Finally , the skeleton framework is in the parametric case as its minimum distance decision is carried out on a finite number of and the oracle e skeleton or the e covering in total variation of Chapter can be by a practical uniform covering of the compact index set Theorem . Finally , it is worth that a preliminary version of this work in the context of density estimation under a data rate constraint was in . The rest of the paper is organized as : Section the setting of the joint and modeling with training data . Section the with zero rate density estimation . Section the main joint and modeling result Theorem and the skeleton estimator . Finally , Section a special case where the are indexed by finite dimensional bounded space the parametric context . A summary of the is in and . Finally , the are in Section . The fixed rate and modeling problem in is in this section . This joint and modeling problem will be the main focus of this work . In addition , and used in the rest of the paper will be . Let be a separable and complete subset of where is the sigma field . Let be the collection of probability on ,, with the sigma field restricted to , and let denote the set of probability absolutely continuous with respect to the measure . For any its probability density function . The total variational distance in is given by to avoid any confusion , a set then its . For to , if we define the set for the pair , by Let : be an i . i .. stochastic process or stationary and memoryless source , where Xi in and a distribution in : . is in general an index set for . The problem of source of a finite block of the process X .., to find a or code from to , where is a finite set . Given a constraint on , the design is to make as close as possible to in average for that a distortion function . The standard problem the knowledge of for finding the optimal code for any finite block , , , as well as for the fundamental performance of this task to infinity , , , . A more realistic scenario is the universal source problem , where the source distribution is unknown and a scheme needs to be designed for the family . Here we focus on a specific learning variation of this task by in , where in addition to the data that needs to be compressed and with respect to a fidelity criterion , we have a finite number of i . i . following the same distribution and that can be used to estimate in the process more of this approach in Section . . This additional data can be as memory , training data , or side information about available at the because it is data that is not to be compressed and . The existence of this memory from the standard zero memory setting considered in universal source . However , this information can be seen as a realistic assumption in the context of a sequential block by block of an infinite sequence , where the data is partitioned into of the same finite length and compressed sequentially block by block . Then in a given stage of this sequential process , the data from previous are available at the lossless for the process the current block . More specifically following the fixed rate block and modeling setting by in , we consider an block scheme with finite memory , where there is a distinction between the data Z .., that is available as side information to estimate the source distribution training data and the data that needs to be and source or test data , under the important assumption that both data are i . i .. of the same unknown probability . A systematic exposition of this setting and its connection with the classical setting of zero memory block is in Section . Formally , let us define an , block code by the pair Then given a set of training and a finite block of the source is the composition of : a function , that to an element in a finite set conditioned on the training data or memory by , and a function that a ,. In this context , into the reproduction the reproduction space . As a short hand , we denote , : that we the , , the reconstruction of by , and its memory for simplicity , the dependency of or , on the memory will be implicit in the rest of the exposition .. The rate of , in per letter is given by . In general , it is not possible to recover from given the constraint on , and thus a single letter distortion measure : is used to quantify the block discrepancy by Finally considering and , the average distortion per letter of , given is which is a function of and hence the average distortion per letter of , is In universal source the performance of a code , is over a collection of and is point wise with the best code that can be assuming that is known . For this analysis , we need the following : Definition . For a finite block distribution , the order operational distortion rate function of at In this context , the operational distortion rate function , is given by The celebrated source theorem a single letter theoretical characterization for in also known as the . A nice exposition of this celebrated result can be found in , , . It is worth that the operational distortion rate function in is equivalent to the classical order operational distortion rate function given by : such that Lemma . . Then , a nonzero memory side information at the does not help in the minimization of the distortion when is known . For the rest of the exposition , we will concentrate on the simple case studied in where i . e ., the block length is equal to the memory of the code . To be precise about the meaning of universality in this context , we resort to some standard : Definition . A scheme ,: is weakly universal for the rate , the first term is the order distortion redundancy , which is the discrepancy that can be exclusively to the goodness of the scheme . The second term in , i . e . to do with how fast to the as the block length to infinity see further in Section and therein . From this observation , Definition . A scheme ,: is strongly finite block universal for the Note that if ,: is strongly universal then it is strongly finite block universal , but the converse result is not true in general . The missing condition to make these two criteria equivalent is the uniform convergence of to in the class . More discussion about this point in Section . by the work of , a two stage block code with finite memory training data , with the objective of doing both fixed rate source , and identification of the source distribution at the receiver . More precisely , given and the training and the source data , respectively , an , joint and modeling rule is given by where finite set of , in two . In the first stage , the pair , in to do density estimation and finite rate quantization by , and an density in . At the end , the first stage the index , the second stage of ,, by , and the source data by In summary , the outcome of the whole process is the concatenation of the that represent first stage , and the that represent , second stage . The process , on the other hand , the first stage to recover and then the second stage to recover . see Figure in which this process is . The rate in per letter of , is Figure . Illustration of two stage joint source and modeling scheme . Top figure the process and the bottom figure the respective process . Based on this two stage scheme , we could simultaneously achieve source and density estimation modeling at the . This new joint and modeling objective the introduction of the following definition : Definition . A joint and modeling scheme ,: in is strongly universal for a class of distribution : at the rate , if Consequently , if ,: is strongly universal for , it that infinity , density estimation is at the in total and , from the source perspective , ,: is strongly finite block universal the sense of Definition . For the rest of the paper , the strongly universality of Definition will be the main and modeling objective . This section a connection between the objective of joint and modeling declared in Definition and a problem of zero rate density estimation . . . Density Estimation with a Rate Constraint Let us first introduce the problem of rate constrained density estimation . Let : be an indexed collection of as in Section . . Definition . An , learning rule of a pair of ,, with : The composition of these two : the rate constrained learning rule in the : , where log its description complexity in per training sample . Definition . The rate is achievable for , if a learning scheme , : such that where Z , Z . in the left hand side of to i . i .. driven by . In this case , we say that is an rate uniformly consistent scheme or estimator for the class . Proposition . If for a given , ,: is strongly universal for the the rate Definition , then its induced finite description learning scheme from the first stage in , i . e ., , : , is a zero rate uniformly consistent estimator for Definition . Interestingly , the existence of a zero rate uniformly consistent scheme also sufficient to achieve the joint and modeling Definition if some mild are adopted from the work in . This is stated in the following result : : can be expressed by , , where , is a bounded metric in with and for all , for all , and for all , there a , block code , say , that the order operational in . Then the existence of a learning scheme , : that is zero rate uniformly consistent there a joint and modeling scheme ,: that is strongly universal rate Definition . Remark . The construction for ,: at any rate in Section . the zero rate density estimation scheme : that : , where is a constant . It is worth that these two summarize the result in Theorem and , importantly , these two are independent of . Remark . An important consequence of the in and is the fact that a learning scheme : with specific of convergence for E , and to infinity a joint and modeling scheme that a uniform rate of convergence to zero over of the overhead in distortion by and a uniform rate of convergence to zero of the overhead in rate by . This observation will be used in all the achievable in and , where , consequently , the problem to determine and for E , and . From the connection with zero rate density estimation in Section , here we present a set of new for the joint and modeling problem of Section . . In these , the general i and stated in Theorem are assumed . Definition . Let be a class of . We say L totally bounded if for every e , there is a finite set of : i .., that , Definition . totally bounded , let Ne denote the positive integer that the condition in . Ne is the e covering number e log Ne is the e entropy of . Definition . An e covering Ge that Ge Ne is an e skeleton of . Theorem . There is a strongly universal joint and modeling scheme any rate if , and only if , is L totally bounded . The part of the proof of Theorem on the adoption of the skeleton estimator with its minimum distance learning principle in , which is a zero rate uniformly consistent density estimator for Definition . Furthermore , Theorem can be saying that the construction ,: derived from the skeleton estimator that is a short hand for the process distribution of by under the i . i .. assumption . Knowing specific for e log Ne , the skeleton estimator can be its design parameter appropriately . In particular , the sequence en see in Section . is selected as the solution of the optimal balance between estimation and approximation see in Section . , which is given by e Chapter . . The of this analysis are in Section . and Chapter . By doing so , an zero rate skeleton scheme , with concrete rate of convergence for , and pen , can be . From and , these imply specific performance for the induced joint and modeling scheme . To illustrate , we present three interesting below . Let : with be the class of which are a convex combination of .., , i . e ., A . is L totally bounded with e being O log e Chapter . . From the optimal sequence is O , which the following finite rate performance bound Chapter . : universal non negative constant . The rate in per O log . the collection of with support on , , monotonically decreasing per and bounded by a constant . This class is known to be L totally bounded , and furthermore e Lemma . , with the only on . From being O n is optimal please see in , with the following performance bound , the class of defined on the bounded support , , continuous integer greater than zero and satisfying that : for a constant . This class is L totally bounded with e being O er Chapter . . From , the optimal sequence , where , o is O n and the rate in per O n . Notably , the last two are fully non parametric , where e is a polynomial function of e . non parametric of L totally bounded of , where e is even exponentially in e , are in . and . and its . Looking at the distortion redundancy bound in , totally bounded the rate convergence that could be with the skeleton estimator in Theorem is O see Section . and the estimation error bound in . In this section , more specific density are studied to achieve this best rate O v for density estimation and distortion redundancy from . We follow the path by in , who of with a finite and dimension the so classes , . Let us first introduce some : Definition . Let : be an indexed collection of . The class for such a collection is given by the class AT a finite dimension A in , and the entropy of associated with the sequence en strictly sub linearly , i . e ., log N is o , then there is a zero rate density estimator scheme , : that where is the skeleton estimator in with en . Furthermore , is also a zero rate strongly consistent density estimator where From Definition , log Ne is inversely proportional to e . In fact , depending of , log Ne can go from being O log e , passing from being polynomial in e , to being O e see a number of in Chapter and its . Then the role of in the statement of Theorem is to bound how fast Ne should tend to infinity as e goes to zero , to guarantee a zero rate in the skeleton learning scheme . It is simple to show that Ne being O e e with , is sufficient to achieve that log N is o . This is a condition satisfied by a rich collection of L totally bounded classes in . Concrete are in Chapter . The so far are of theoretical interest because they rely on the skeleton estimator that is from the skeleton covering of see Definition , which is unknown in practice . Moving towards making the zero rate skeleton learning scheme of practical interest , we revisit the important parametric scenario in which , the index set of , is a compact set in a finite dimensional space . Interestingly , in this context we can consider a practical covering by the uniform partition of the parameter space , as used in . Unlike , where a minimum distance estimate is first found and then , here we first quantize the then find the minimum distance estimate among a finite collection of i . e ., over a number of in . Some will be . Definition . Let : with . Let IF : be the index function to . IF is said to be locally uniformly , if there and , such , where the ball of radius with respect to the norm in centered at . The following lemma L totally bounded under some parametric . Lemma . Let : with . bounded such that bounded . Furthermore and the is O IF : for this family . is locally uniformly Definition , L totally It is important to note that the e covering in the proof of Lemma to derive an upper bound for Ne is practical see Appendix . This the possibility of a practical skeleton estimator , which is the focus of the following result . Under the of Lemma , let , e ,, e denote the learning rule of with the minimum distance principle in with parameter e see in Section . , where instead of the e skeleton Ge of in Definition , the see Appendix e covering the proof of Lemma is used . This practical e covering is by e by definition , Ne e O , this last part from Lemma .. With this , let , en , denote our practical learning scheme indexed by the precision en . We are in a position to integrate Theorem and Lemma to state the following : Theorem . Under the of Lemma , the practical skeleton estimator en with en that When , that the finite dimension assumption of Theorem is satisfied by the class of mixture in Section . . and a rich collection of exponential of the form : with , where is a reference density , hi : i .., is a set of arbitrary real valued , is a normalization constant see in Section , a compact subset of see in Section . We summarize the of the zero rate density estimation approach adopted for the problem of joint fixed rate source and modeling of continuous memoryless . Proposition and Theorem formalize the interplay between the two stage joint fixed rate and modeling objective and the problem of zero rate uniformly consistent in total variation density estimation . Theorem a necessary and sufficient condition on a family of for the existence of a strongly joint and modeling scheme both source and model identification Definition . The result is for the rich non parametric collection of L totally bounded . For the modeling stage , we propose the skeleton estimator , which first the data and then the minimum distance decision on this finite set of density . This is a practical solution in the sense that the inference minimization is carried out over a finite set . By combinatorial regularity on the family of : , the skeleton scheme O rate of convergence in the order distortion redundancy , and the same rate in the total variational distance for the modeling part Theorem . • Finally , for a relevant parametric setting , a practical skeleton based joint is that a rate of for the order distortion redundancy Theorem . This rate is slightly better than the O in under the same rate overhead of O log . Furthermore , Theorem the finite dimension assumption over the class AT considered in Theorem . , while the same performance in of order distortion redundancy O , uniform risk to learn the Concerning the last parametric result , we note that the result in can be by the adoption of Dudley entropy bound , which would yield the same asymptotic rate in this work for the order distortion redundancy . A final remark is that under the bounded distortion metric assumption of Theorem condition i , Linder al . Theorem that , and for every such that , there is a constant such that where is a sequence that to zero o uniformly in . This result a rate of convergence of the order operational distortion rate function to the as the block length to infinity . In view of , we can adopt this result in and , to say that the average distortion of the respective joint and modeling at rate , i . e ., ,, to the as O point wise . Therefore in the process of This work the problem of fixed rate universal source and model identification with training data in from a learning perspective . Remarkably , we found that the problem is equivalent to the problem of density estimation of the source distribution with some concrete but non conventional operational data rate in per sample . This learning problem can be seen as the task of and the distribution of with a zero rate in per sample , while a consistent estimation in total of the distribution after the process . From our perspective , the rate constraint density estimation problem is interesting in itself and can have relevant in other such as distributed learning and sensor network . Importantly for the joint and modeling problem , the connection with density estimation a context for the use of the skeleton estimator by in . We highlight two important from its use . First , we extend about universality from the parametric context in to the rich non parametric family of L totally bounded , . This result significantly the where the joint model and objective can be . We this with some in Section . and many more can be found in the literature of density estimation , . Second , in the parametric case studied in , we were able to remove some of the and obtain not only the same performance result in of rate of convergence of the order distortion redundancy but also slightly better convergence . Therefore , the Skeleton estimator , though essentially a non parametric learning scheme , is shown to be instrumental in enriching the applicability of the joint and modeling framework . Proof . The fact that is uniformly consistent directly from Definition . On the other hand , the rate of is . From the definition of , it is simple to show from the strict of that in order for limn , i , it is that e for any e . Then , from , and since log , lim , that limn . Proof . The proof upon the in Theorem . ,. . Let us consider an arbitrary and let , : be the zero rate learning scheme of the assumption let us construct the joint and modeling rule of : Concerning the first stage of ,: , it is induced directly from the of .

From construction and the fact that zero rate , then ,: the rate condition . On the other hand , based on the assumption that is zero rate uniformly consistent , it that where . Then ,: the modeling objective . Concerning the objective , we use the following key result : Lemma Lemma . . two probability in ,. Let , be a zero memory block coder with the nearest neighbor property i . e ., is nearest neighbor if ,, with the reproduction of .. If we denote the performance where the product measure with , , and the condition i of Theorem and is bounded by , then Furthermore , the inequality can be extended for the order operational in , i . e ., For the first equality we use . The inequality in is from the definition in and , and the equality in is from the construction of which is operational optimal for the distribution at rate . Finally , is from . Concluding , , is random a measurable function of and dominated by . Hence taking the value with respect to on both sides of this inequality Proof . Let us first assume L totally bounded and prove the direct part of the statement . We adopt the skeleton estimate by and extended by al . , a complete presentation can be found in Chapter . For any arbitrary e , let us consider the o e e skeleton Ge .., Ne of . We use ie i as short hand for the i th in to represent the index set of Ge . Let us consider the class of Ge given by Hence , given i . i .. X .., with Xi , let us propose the pair , e e associated with Ae by , is the well known skeleton estimate . is the minimum distance approximation of with of Ge , , the measure in the right hand side of that is reminiscent of the total variational distance in . In order to choose a sequence en , we consider the following performance bound . Equation is valid for any e and , consequently , it a trade off between an approximation error term and an estimation error term . The approximation error is Ge which is bounded by the definition of Ge . For the estimation error , on the other hand , the use of inequality to obtain that Theorem . , in , it that This last expression is distribution free and it is valid if the approximation fidelity e is a chosen function of . Consequently , for any sequence en , Chapter . , which is well defined and to zero infinity . Consequently from , limn . Then the learning scheme O by construction . To conclude the argument of this part i . e ., the construction of the second stage of a joint modeling scheme , we adopt the result and the construction in the proof of Theorem see Remark for . This result that there is a strongly universal joint and modeling scheme rate . For the other implication the converse part of the statement , let us fix and assume that we have a joint modeling scheme that is strongly universal Definition rate . Then from Proposition , we have a learning scheme , : such that limn and For the learning rule of length , we have its reproduction that we denote by . Let us define the minimum distance oracle solution in by From , we have that limn , . In other , e , there e , such that for all e , , e uniformly for every .

First note in a compact set , consequently , the finite covering property of a compact set , i . e ., e , there a finite covering such that , e On the other hand , from the locally uniformly assumption on IF :, there and such that , , , .

Hence , from , e e o there e min e ,,..., e , such that i , which the result . For the final part , let , be the uniform that characterize the condition of from IF Definition Ne is upper bounded by . Without loss of generality , let us assume the critical regime e , which is the covering number of me hence , we will work with a uniform partition of to find a bound for e . Let e me , then a product type partition , where in each we have uniform length , we have the e covering . The number of is O , which is O as a function of e e e . To clarify the constructive nature of the e covering used to prove this result , an algorithm with the basic of the construction of this practical covering is in Appendix . Proof .

Some of the useful temporal statistics of channel like this are the power delay profile , the average delay and the delay , which allow one to determine spectral statistics such as coherence and average power gain under suitable , been extensively in the literature , . In contrast , the second order statistics of the channel power frequency response have received less attention . In , it been shown that the number of significant of the covariance matrix of the random channel impulse response , and hence the diversity order of the channel , scales approximately linearly with . Such an increase in diversity , which to the reduction of the relative channel power variance as the , been to reach a saturation point , . In a recent paper , analytical for the of the channel frequency response squared magnitude , here by , as well as the variance of the power over any frequency band , have been derived for the . . a channel model , conditioned to fixed and given ray and cluster arrival times . The corresponding statistics over random arrival times were via . To the best of the knowledge , no closed form are available in the literature for second order un conditional statistics of the spectral power gain of wireless channel such as the . . a and the . In this paper , we derive closed form for the second order statistics of for greater than some minimum value min rad , whose precise definition will be given later . Statistical randomness of ray an arrival times , for a generalized version of the ultra wide band microwave indoor channel model accepted by the . . a task group . We obtain these within a framework general enough to be compatible with other related channel , such the . The flexibility of our formulation it to include some of the in the . . a standard channel model for high as well . As in all these , our channel description is based upon and with , with different average power decay among and within . We first derive a closed form expression for the of . We then use this result to obtain an analytical expression for the variance and raw second order moment of the channel power gain within any given interval min . This us to estimate fade depth as a function of channel explicit . Our also predict a positive lower bound to the ratio between the variance of and its squared mean . This bound only as the arrival rate of in the model to infinity . In this section we formulate the wireless channel model framework which will be throughout this work . As in the . . a channel model , we describe the radio propagation of indoor by a random impulse response of the form is the random arrival time of the th path in the i th cluster , Ti is the random arrival time of the i th cluster , and ti , is the random delay of the th path in the i th cluster relative to Ti . Each real valued random coefficient ai , the amplitude of the th path in cluster i . These random are formed as where Ai is a random variable the amplitude of the i th cluster , pi , are un binary random taking from , , and each real valued random variable ai , the amplitude or gain of the th path or ray within the i th cluster relative to that cluster amplitude . For simplicity , we do not consider here a large scale fading factor before the sum in , but its effects can be applied to our with ease . As in , , , all the random in the super set Ti ti , Ai pi , ai , are independent , except Ai from Ti , and ai , from ti ,, for all i ,. For future use , we describe the dependency of the second and of Ai and ai , on Ti and ti ,, respectively , by of the following : In our formulation , the number of Ti and the number of ti , that take within any unit length time interval follow with mean and , respectively . This is also part of the channel of and . By choosing the ai as distributed , for fixed and given , and deterministic Ai with the form Ai b Ti , , for some ,, , the above description the widely used model . A similar choice with log normally distributed Ai and ai the model by the . . a task group excluding its large scale fading term . The decay of the by can also be chosen to match those that the . a standard for high in some scenario such as office and industrial . Mixed , another model feature present in , can be handled within the current framework with little additional effort . In , the number of and the number of within each cluster are finite . Such choice to the fact that , in practice , choosing and large enough will be sufficient to include all path component with significant power . This is equivalent to saying that for every e , there exist finite and such that with probability close to . Clearly , this equivalence that the decay fast enough with increasing delay . We will make this requirement precise by assuming that the conditional of the satisfy We will also assume that the conditional moment , b , and g decay slow enough so that , for some minimum angular frequency min rad , we can approximate where the non negative integer ni satisfy n n , n n . Thus , our will be valid for and where the band of interest above min . In general , the for which is a good approximation will be determined by whichever of the within the integral of . Therefore , min will depend mostly on the decay time of the , the reciprocal of which should be several times smaller than min . Since and arrival times are random , so is . In the following we will derive analytical for the second order statistics of as well of the channel power over a given frequency interval . Here we will obtain closed form for the mean and correlation coefficient of over any interval of angular , min , . To derive these , we will make use of the following technical lemma . Lemma : Suppose the sequence of non negative random a process with finite arrival rate be any two such that exist and are bounded . Then where E expectation with respect to all the random that determine the expression within the square . Proof : For each of i . i .. random uniformly distributed over ,. We have that and the independence between stated in the previous section , we obtain Thus , the value of at any min is the product of the average energy of the cluster Ai and the ray relative ai ,. Notice also that E ai ti the average power profile of in a cluster with amplitude Ai . For this reason , it will be to as the the cluster . Similarly , E Ai Ti the average power density of cluster . Accordingly , we will call the inter cluster power delay profile . For notational simplicity , we will temporarily adopt a single indexing nomenclature for the path arrival times ti ,. More precisely , and with a slight abuse of notation , we define the infinite random set For our , it will not be necessary to define a between the i , and the index . Indeed , it will be sufficient to note that the double index matching condition the single index , , i is equivalent . single index notation , the first term on the right hand side of is from , which ray arrival times ti ,, which imply that the in the sum of are zero for the ,. ,,, ,, and ,, this from , , and the independence between Ai , ai ,, Ti and ti , in the previous section , we obtain It can already be seen from that the the sum of a frequency independent term and a term which only on the frequency difference . From , the latter term as this frequency difference to infinity , so because of the first term , the between two infinitely distant frequency is greater than zero . At first sight this may seem . Nevertheless , such behaviour also been found in , and is consistent with the saturation of the channel diversity order as in , . As will be in Remark below , such behaviour is due to the fact that the arrival for and its path are finite . Indeed , as the path environment becomes , i . e ., the number of path component , the constant term to zero . Before the last step in our derivation of a simpler closed form expression for , , we define With these , and Lemma , we obtain that the of is given by and , respectively . Notice in this expression that only the K and K depend on the conditional fourth order of the . Therefore , for given inter and cluster , the of ray and cluster will modify the frequency independent K and K . Nevertheless , such change would have no effect on the frequency dependency of the spectral power . Remark : Dense impulse If we keep the average energy of the the cluster and impulse constant while increasing the cluster arrival rate to infinity , then the frequency independent in and vanish . To see this , notice that the cluster impulse response energy is given by where Lemma been used . Thus , if we keep this average energy constant and increase the density by a factor , then the have to be divided by . By uniformly scaling the Ai to yield such reduction , the resulting function b is divided by . Therefore , the integral of b in the form b , which clearly to zero as . From this analysis it that the of when the impulse response becomes infinitely dense , say , the simple form That is , in this case is the product of the squared magnitude of the inter cluster and the cluster at . In this section we will derive closed form for the mean and variance of the channel power over any band Value of the Channel Power Over a Frequency Band : Denote the channel power over the frequency . Given the fact that E is constant for all min see , it from that The variance of the channel power over a band , , min , can be directly from the of as : The fluctuation of the received power over a wireless where ,, as defined in . channel its fade statistics . The fact that fade depth with channel been in the literature , both from empirical data see , e .., as well as . However , a closed form formula fade depth and the classical channel model used here , to the best of our knowledge , not been to date . The derived above allow us to easily deal with this issue , as seen in the example of the next section . In this section we will illustrate the application of the previous , our framework to the classical model . In this model , the ai , are distributed and the Ai are deterministic exponentially . The decay profile of the ray is given by where is the average power gain of a ray at the beginning of a cluster at Ti . Since the fourth moment E x of a distributed random related to its second order moment as E E , we have that In order to find the of for this example , we substitute into , The variance of is directly by , which the previous expression for Thus , again it can be that , as in Remark , the lower asymptote of the spectral power correlation only when the cluster arrival rate as the mean channel power is kept constant .. Second Order Statistics Over a Band The variance of the channel power over a band min , rad is by substituting into , and then the in . This On the other hand , from , E . Thus , the channel power variance for this example is Equation several interesting about the channel power variance , which are below : The channel power variance is the sum of three . The first one to K , which on all the except the . It is inversely proportional to the product , which is in turn proportional to the average number of with significant in the channel impulse response . This term is the lower asymptote of E when , and the latter limit to total channel power variance divided by its squared mean . Again , in agreement with what was shown in Remark , this term only when the impulse response becomes infinitely dense with . From the viewpoint of , this is by the fact that , with a finite number of with random , the law of large does not apply to the total impulse response energy , and hence its variance to squared mean ratio is not zero . The second term on the of all the other , except , which it does Although also the right hand side of vanish , grow unbounded would violate the under which the above are valid see and . Figure . coefficient for with from the . . a . are over . channel . p . The analytical plot was and . not change with the arrival rate of within . This term is monotonically decreasing in and , approaching when , and when . It also when the cluster arrival rate to infinity . The third term only the and inter cluster power decay . In particular , it is independent of cluster and ray arrival . It is monotonically decreasing with the , tending to zero when to infinity , and to when . It can be seen that the channel power variance over a band unbounded as . This is due to the fact that , when , the channel power is close to zero with increasing probability . To see how this tendency can make the ratio E go to infinity , consider a simpler exam . Let the discrete random the with with probability . Then E , which clearly goes to infinity as . The narrow band channel power variance , P E P is from by . The ratio between the of power of a and a system , i . e ., P E P E can be as a measure of frequency diversity order . From , such diversity order would range from when to , when . For » , the latter limit is approximately , which is roughly twice the average number of that fall within . It can also be seen from that before reaching this limit , and for » , the diversity order approximately linearly with , consistent with , . The coefficient for with the of the . . a is plotted in Figure , both from and from our . The of the are : . , . , , and . . It can be seen from this figure that from channel agree well with . In particular , w , the . threshold for p between and p , as by , and close to its lower asymptotic value when p . We derived general that characterize the statistics of the frequency response power gain in microwave indoor . Our are applicable to several well established channel in the literature . In particular , the closed form formula here for the of the squared frequency response magnitude of the channel one to predict the variance of the channel power over any frequency band . This an approximation to the diversity order of wide band over in such . Our also allow one to obtain an upper bound for this measure of diversity , and show how and why this limit from a finite number of in the channel impulse response . ﻿ We present empirical on the achievable cellular system throughput gains stemming from the use of remote radio in an urban environment . Our work is based on simultaneous path loss of the base station and links to outdoor street level . We calculated the increase in received power , when a is added to improve the coverage by a . We consider diverse for the and diverse coverage for the mobile station , the effect of height and position with respect to the intended . We also compare the power gains that would be in practice from combining such as selection combining and maximum ratio combining . We conclude that under practical , the of will depend very strongly on the existence of line links between the and the intended . For at low , below the clutter , only in a position with respect to the will obtain a significant benefit . Our data also that the gains in signal to noise ratio when are only marginally better than those of the much simpler . Index Channel modeling , maximum ratio combining , remote radio , selection combining , small , wireless . NE of the great for today wireless communication is to provide adequate spatial coverage in a cost effective way , while efficiency and interference adequate for high frequency re use . To meet this challenge there been a growing interest in the study of , relay and low complexity , . These may constitute relatively simple , and easy to install when to the deployment of an additional base station to serve mobile within the cell . While are as a small coverage with low transmit power connected to a wired network , a is connected to a through a wireless link , being able to repeat or re code the data by amplify and forward or forward , among . A repeater may be thought of as an amplify and forward relay with no or ability . In this context , there are two basic of : wireless , and remote radio , also known as fiber , connected to a by an optical fiber . will suffer large and small scale fading at both and links . In contrast , for wireless , achievable gains will only depend on the quality of the connection , which it an attractive solution to provide connectivity to wireless in dense urban , where the links to the may experience significant shadowing . Proper placement of a is obviously a fundamental factor in the compromise between the desired gains and the cost associated with its installation . In this regard , in an urban environment it is reasonable to expect that while coverage will improve with antenna height , this will at the same time have a negative impact on deployment and on channel interference , thus affecting frequency reuse in a large system , . If the is to cover an area of a size comparable to a small cell , then it is reasonable to assume that this is best by its antenna in normally used by . In such well established propagation such as those of and al . will be adequate to predict the coverage by the . Alternatively , they may be positioned at lower with the aim of in more limited , i . e ., generating within a large cell . Coverage in growing interest as it can provide local in signal to noise ratio and thus high data , . This may be without generating excessive interference in neighboring and at lower implementation when to a , , , particularly when below clutter height . Numerous empirical have been for the statistical characterization of path loss in relatively low height radio links . Analytical based on optical geometry have also been for in urban , . Goldsmith al . , based on a collection of , a mathematical description of the radius of coverage of a for an urban environment with and without line of sight . of local mean attenuation are for two , and it is found that these have the shape of convex . al . in an indoor outdoor environment operating under Amplify and Forward and Decode and Forward . In , the studied different of and in cellular , concluding that careful placement of can improve capacity substantially , transferring traffic from heavily loaded to lightly loaded , thereby improving network capacity . They also conclude , based on their , that it is best to place on a horseshoe layout with a sum transmission power of all comparable to the transmission power of a single macro base transceiver station . The . Relay Task Group and the WINNER Consortium have the use of both empirical and theoretical to predict path for wireless links with transmission below the clutter of , also applicable to links . While the accuracy of for diverse been the subject of extensive , their use in wireless more than treating each link individually , since the joint statistics of and links may not correspond to those of independent random . In this work , we report an empirical study that the joint statistics for the path of the links involved in a cellular system by . Specifically , our are based on simultaneous path loss of the and links in an outdoor urban environment . Based on our we evaluate diverse related to the performance improvement that can be when a in an area by a . We focus on modeling the statistics of the radio links involved and the resulting gains in received power by the mobile user . Our will be useful to calculate the achievable gains in transmission experienced by mobile . Our empirical study firstly considered the influence of the height . Toward that end , we by the in a tall building position , typical for an urban radio cell , and then lowering it stepwise to a height of . In this study , we considered street level user spread over a disk with a radius of centered at the . Path loss data for all links involved was collected at each height . The us to quantify the between height and the achievable gains in coverage and received power . For our test , it was found that on average an increase in height of the an increase in received power of about for every . Overall , the suggest that the effectiveness of a system is quite limited if a large area is to be covered , unless the is positioned at such a height and at such that in practice it becomes another urban . This conclusion led to the second part of our study , where we restricted to a disk with a radius of only centered at the . In addition , we the at lamp post , considering that this type of setting will be typical for a practical deployment of low cost . In this part of the study we also considered two of . One was chosen so as to maximize the likelihood of to the and the other chosen in close proximity to the first , but from direct street view by construction . In this way we were able to evaluate the effect of blocking a , as may occur when a surrounding construction is after the placement of the fiber repeater . Our are only directly applicable to narrow band transmission , for example a single carrier of an transmission , as our were done with unmodulated . We also report that involve spatial , i . e ., the elimination of small scale . This is equivalent to spatial diversity , which often similar to frequency diversity . From the joint data of path loss for the and links we were able to compare the effectiveness of Selection Combining and Maximal Ratio Combining at the mobile terminal . To this effect we considered typical transmit and antenna gains at the and and calculated received signal power at the under the condition of equal noise power for both . It was found that the statistical gain of over is less than under all tested , a consequence of the random power imbalance among the links . Our also us to calculate between for the and links for all . The low validate the approach based on considering them as independent random . The rest of this paper is organized as : In Section we present a detailed description of the measurement scenario and . The related to the effect of height on the achievable gains are in Section . In Section , we present the empirical when a at lamp post height . are in Section . The measurement campaign extended over a period of during summertime . The urban area used as in Mar , Chile , a mix of high rise and two story with ranging from to , built on a plane region at sea level . of received power at were carried out at . The area is by nearby that a transmitter at a location typical for a covering a relatively large urban area . The height was above the measurement region at a distance of to the position . The was mounted at various on the external wall of a high building as will be later . The streets in the measurement area are lined with with ranging from to . All links were of sight , with due to the surrounding construction . A schematic description of the scenario and terrain profile is in . and . The second scenario was based on the same urban for both base and but with all within a disk with a radius of centered at the position of a . The was this time at above street level . The disposition of the user is shown in Fig . . Fig . . Placement of , and in urban environment for the first part of this study . a Tested , D view . A block diagram of the measurement system is shown in Fig . . At the position , a continuous wave source based on a oscillator a . unmodulated carrier with output power through a sector type antenna , corresponding to an of . The antenna used had azimuth and elevation Fig . . Placement of and in urban environment for the second part of this study . at . All were within this . At the , the antenna used was a vertically dipole with gain , a signal at . with output power , corresponding to an of . The choice of was based on the fact that they fall inside a band used for Metropolitan Area such as and that considerable previous work in this band been , providing a reference framework on propagation in urban . The was to contain a transmitter and a receiver tuned to the frequency . This us to remotely detect any possible anomaly at the , which was at a considerable distance from our measurement scenario . The separation between and provided enough isolation to allow simultaneous transmission and reception by the . Power at the were carried out an model NA spectrum analyzer that simultaneously tracked the at . and . . The antenna used was a gain vertically dipole at a . height . The dynamic range of the measurement setup is limited from below by the system noise floor . only the spectrum analyzer as receiver , this proved to be inadequate for several of the user and would have our if we had only selected the where were feasible . We thus included a gain amplifier at the mobile antenna terminal to achieve a system noise figure of and thus a noise floor of in a . The resulting link budget us to measure path of up to in the link and in the link . At all selected the average received power the noise floor by at least . The measurement system included a computer that acquired the spectrum analyzer at a rate of per second . The received power from the and us to calculate the corresponding path for both links . The two measurement involved moving the along a straight path of about . at each of the diverse in the region tested . This was done a very slow moving vehicle on which our measurement equipment was . We traversed each . sector at a constant speed in such a way that approximately equally spaced power were collected . At the frequency , this that more than of the are at spaced at least half a apart . From these we the average path loss at the location and the small scale fade statistics with respect to this average . The first measurement campaign was at the effect of height . This involved the at different , ranging from to above street level . measurement for the were selected at various from the : within , between and and between and . These are marked with in Fig . . for in the range from to did in some result in path exceeding the reliable measurement range for received power . Thus , to avoid our , the statistics for this part of our study exclude data for below . The second set of , at the practical performance gains for low , was based on , but all within of the , as in Fig . . Of these , were within , between and , and between and of the . The at a height of above street level , was at two different : one at an intersection so as to simultaneously illuminate two streets and the other one within of the first placement , but with no direct path to the adjacent streets . In the first case there are and user , while in the second all are . In this section we quantify the effect of lowering the antenna from a position where in practice it can be considered another , to close to street level . To characterize our scenario , we first contrast the measured path with the corresponding by propagation . In various for path loss prediction are , some of which correspond to similar to the one used here as a test bed . These do not explicitly consider the height variation of the or relay , but are based on the relative position of these with respect to the user , i . e ., , above or below clutter . Among these , we chose the one that best our . Specifically we considered the alternative WINNER model for urban Type E links , with a above height and mobile below . The by this model were to the path loss link , considering the various . The for these links range to . The comparison is shown in Fig . where at all and for all are included . For this comparison we out small scale , thus generating one path loss value for each combination of height and position , which is to be to the model prediction . The separation of the empirical data into and was based on whether or not the line of sight path was blocked by a large structure such as a building . We considered that a tree in the direct path does not alter a condition . To avoid the figure we combined the for the various into three : to , to and to . The corresponding by the model is plotted considering a at a height in the center of the range of for each group . We note that the model is little affected by this height . We also show for reference the free space path loss . As can be seen , the path loss are within range of the model , although we some path loss reduction with height , not for by the model . The same figure also the of the path loss considering all , which as fall well below the model prediction . We further the statistics of our empirical path for each height to those of the classical log distance model with log normal shadow fading and Rice small scale . As is common practice , we chose the model to adjust to the free space path loss at the reference distance of . We found that this model provided a very good fit , with a path loss exponent ranging from . to . when considering . When considering only the , the path loss exponent varied between . and . . The were at the highest position , with a clearly observable increase as the was towards street level . The standard deviation with respect to the regression line was in the range of to , with little difference between and links . For all of the , the statistics of the small scale fit the distribution , within the accuracy that result from a finite data set . For the links the Rice distribution Fig . . Empirical path loss to WINNER model according to . j recommendation . provided a similarly good fit , with that were quite small , no than . The above indicate that our choice of measurement scenario the propagation behavior of an urban environment , as in the literature , by shadowing and by strong propagation . To evaluate the achievable received power gain as a function of the height , we calculated the received power at the , assuming realistic for transmit power and antenna gains . We note that once the path for all links have been , we are free in subsequent to assume any transmit power for the and the , not necessarily those used before in the channel sounding process . In the calculation of received power at the , we thus used the actual measured path for the links , and transmit power that we reasonable for an actual deployment . From the collection of calculated power at the , we the cumulative distribution function of the received power . For this we considered transmission by alone , by alone , and transmission by both and with or at the . We considered a with of transmission power , typical for a . The and are assumed to be the same as the used in our and , respectively . For the we assumed that in most practical the would be attached to a wall and consequently only illuminate a sector of in azimuth . All our are in fact within a sector of such angular width . We thus considered that a typical , sector antenna would be used , consistent with in . For the transmit power at the we used two that cover what could be considered the high and low of a practical deployment : and . The lower value is representative for , while the high value is in the power range for and . Figure the of the received power assuming that the at . The consider all power at all . We Fig . . of received power at for , coverage radius and power . for all between and but we here only show the corresponding to . The for essentially match the of the power received from the alone , with a shift to the right of less than at all probability . We do not include them in the figure to avoid the graph . All other fall between these two and are also for the sake of clarity . The improvement in coverage over that by the alone was only found to be significant when the a high position . Not shown here is the case where the at , which in virtually no gain at any position . Fig . that the received power gain of over is almost insignificant . This is due to the fact that the likelihood of similar received power from and is quite small , and as well known , even for equal power the gain is only . We repeated these for diverse of to power with the result that the improvement in received power of over under all was no greater than . As before , this equal receiver noise in both , thus the power gain is equivalent to gain . Based on the above , we describe below the that were for the link in this setting . All our subsequent are based on the assumption of a at the user terminal , but for all practical the would be no different a . From Fig . it is seen that , under the stated , of will receive at least when only the is operating . a at the maximum height , at this coverage to . At the other extreme , a at will provide virtually no statistically significant improvement in coverage , as the corresponding of received power was found to exhibit a right shift of less than . Obviously lower will further reduce any . We note that these rather limited gains were considering a relatively Fig . . Power gain of over alone , for diverse as function of height with transmission power of . high transmit power , only less than that of the base , which does however have a advantage over the , due to the difference in the corresponding antenna gains . To quantify the gains we define as the difference in received power that can be to a proportion of . We refer to this proportion as the availability level associated with that power gain . We denote the of received power from the alone and from of and as and respectively . The gain in received power is then : The same definition of course to the gain through . We now use to calculate , at various availability , the power gain resulting from the use of a . This is shown in Fig . for the full range of at of , and , considering of transmit power at the . To construct this figure we considered the empirical as in Fig . , but calculated for each height . In Fig . we also indicate as a reference the that would have been if instead of the measured for path , these had been calculated at each location a fixed path loss equal to the average value by the before . Specifically , for the link we used the alternative WINNER model for type E in while at the links we used the model , to a frequency of . . Since height dependence is not part of the model in , the resulting gain , which we found to be . , is only a function of the in the region . In contrast , the empirical gains show considerable height dependence . From the data that Fig . is based on , we calculated by linear regression the increase in received power . height of the . The result was that under the stated , Fig . . and power gains of over alone , for diverse as function of height with transmission power of . the power gain is approximately for every in height increase , at of and . If the power is reduced to this gain becomes only . for every . We note that these represent the range of height related gains for our particular choice of and thus cannot be easily generalized . From a qualitative perspective however , the may suggest that the gain with height is mostly due to the fact that at the higher , the number of that exhibit a link to the is . To investigate this aspect further , we segmented the , separating the into those with , and those without , for each height . The resulting power gain . height is shown in Fig . . In this figure we also show the percentage of . As seen , for the there is little gain improvement as the height . On the other hand , for the , there is more evidence of gain increase with height . The main conclusion that may be derived from this figure is that the benefit significantly more from increasing the height of the than those that are . We also note some gain with height , even when the percentage of location a saturation level . Thus , the growth in the percentage of links with does not by itself account for the gains with height . Finally , to evaluate the degree of dependence of the in the and links we calculate the coefficient between these for each height as where and represent respectively the path , the small scale , from the and the to a specific position . E and E are the statistical of these path at the distance under consideration , from a linear regression of path loss . distance . and are the standard of the with respect to these . This calculation was repeated for each height . The were very small . Only at the height did approach . , while at all it was less than . in modulus . We also calculated the of the shadow , i . e . the after out the small scale . This would be more representative for links with space or frequency diversity , which to suppress small scale . In this case was somewhat , but still not significant , reaching . at the height and between positive and negative less than . in modulus at above . The of the previous section suggest that even with a position at a height that is comparable to that of an urban cell , only modest gains can be at a large coverage radius . This even at a relatively high transmit power . In this section we therefore explore more practical , limited to much smaller coverage and a lower height above street level , as we have in Section . In this setup we also the effect of choosing a position with an uncluttered path to two streets , in contrast with it in a nearby position by construction . The first placement is here as Non and the second as O . The position links to some of the chosen . For a setting where both are below clutter , links are as being in a street canyon . Correspondingly , we refer to the links as non street canyon . In the radius , half of the links are of the type while all O links are non street canyon . Within the radius all links to the become of street canyon type . This classification according to the link is , as before , at which can be in practice to benefit most from a given placement . We again first that the chosen are such that the path loss statistics for the environment correspond to well established propagation . For the links , we found a good match to the model and to the alternative WINNER path loss model for the type case in , an operating frequency of . . With respect to these , our measured were slightly higher , and on average , with root mean square ... of and respectively . The measured for the street canyon links were far lower than those for links at the same distance , from to , with on average . They were however higher by about on average than those by the advanced model for Type with both and below . The path loss these are shown in Fig . . As before , we also that our data fit the statistics of the log distance model , with log normal shadow fading and Rice small scale . The resulting were . and . for and links respectively . We note that , as before , most of our links were at least partially by relatively large . Fig . . Empirical path loss to reference for low height .

We illustrate as an example , only the case where the at for both . All other are as before . As seen , the achievable gains very much depend on the specific placement of the . For example , at coverage , the will guarantee a power of at least . an O will guarantee the same power to of , while an will increase this coverage to . When this calculation under the assumption of a transmit power of , the coverage to and respectively . We summarize the gains for various in what . To evaluate the effect of coverage range we divided the where the power were carried out into three with disk radii of , and , to the . Table I the power gain as defined in , with a at the availability of , and , for two transmit and for the two . The are almost identical . We recall that for a radius of or less the placement street canyon type links to all , while only of the are in that condition for the radius . The tabulated provide some interesting insight into the that can be from the use of a . We first note that for and availability , there are consistent in power gain as the coverage radius , particularly when all user become of street canyon type with respect to the . This increase is especially sharp at availability . The at availability , while not as relevant in practice , serve to illustrate the gains available to a minority of that have a particularly low path loss to the , for example due to an unobstructed path at a short range . We in fact see that the gains available to of at a radius are comparable to those for within the shorter . The two smaller radii include only street canyon type links for the case , however the variation in distance from the various user to the is obviously for the than for the case . At high availability this significantly power gains for the smaller radius , as it will exclude most user with higher path to the . Not as obvious is the fact that when considering availability , the power gains can actually decrease with the radius , as seen in the table . This is due to the fact that the smaller radius may also exclude some user that exhibit particularly low path to the . It is precisely these few well with respect to the that dominate the achievable gains for low availability . In the same context , we observe that for the , a increase in transmit power in almost exactly the same increase in received power to the best . This again that for such , the received power is completely dominated by that of the . Both Fig . and Table I illustrate the importance of proper of the . This can also be associated with the fact that the position street canyon type links , particularly at the radius of and . We further explore this below . Based on our above we divided the for all links with up to length into street canyon and non street canyon , rather than by distance as before . Table the for the power gain under this classification , again the previously detailed in Section . The illustrate that very considerable power gains are available for street canyon links , even at low . In contrast , the row corresponding to the non links very modest gains regardless of the position . The latter were considering only that are of non street canyon type under both , so that are based on a common set of data . SELECTION COMBINING GAIN WITH LOW HEIGHT , WITH . To illustrate the gains achievable under the most favorable and , we present in Fig . the for received power considering all street canyon within the disk of radius , at a power of . When this figure with Fig . , it becomes clear that the street canyon within the radius are those that contribute most significantly to the in received power . For example the will provide at least to of . This same minimum power will be available to of if a is included . this for an assumed transmit power coverage to virtually . Finally we again calculated correlation of for the and links , for O and . In both these were found to be below . . When are out , this to . . Our work that in an urban environment a cannot be to yield significant for an ensemble of that is distributed over a disk region with a radius Fig . . of received power at street canyon for coverage radius and power . of centered at the . Under our , based on typical of power and antenna gains , only limited in received power or coverage are available even when the is at considerable height and at only less power than the . Limiting the coverage radius to , significantly the from a . It important gains even when at as low as and operating at the relatively low power of . However , these gains are basically associated with the existence of or , equivalently , links to , and thus heavily depend on site specific and user . In all , the gains achievable are only marginally than those by a , to the fact that , in practice , the likelihood of the and the base providing comparable is very small . Our show that the of the user link and the base user link are essentially independent . Moreover , measured path for such links were found to be quite consistent with average from accepted for the corresponding urban setting . Thus such can lead to a basic prediction of the gains achievable from the use of a . ﻿ This work a necessary and sufficient condition for a stationary and ergodic process to be compressible in the sense by Amini , and Compressibility of deterministic and random infinity Signal Process ., vol . , no . , .

These can play an important role in regression , signal reconstruction for instance in the classical compressed setting , Th . , inference , and decision making , . One important case is such a compressibility notion for i . i .. where the probability measure is with a density function , . In this context , of the process are non sparse almost surely , and conventional ways of compressibility for finite dimensional , based on the power law decay of the best term approximation error or that belong to the weak ball , are not applicable either , as shown in , . by this problem , Amini al . and al . have new for compressible random . These are not based on the typical absolute approximation error decay pattern of the , but on a relative best term approximation error behavior . In particular , Amini al . formally define the concept of compressible process in Section below . This new definition a meaningful way of i . i .. random and their , in of the probability that almost all the relative energy of the process is concentrated in an arbitrarily small sub dimension of the domain , as the block length to infinity . Under this context , they provide two important the theory of order statistics . First of all , , Theorem that a concrete family of i . i .. heavy tail is compressible the generalized , and log logistic , while on the other side , , Theorem that with exponentially such as generalized are not compressible . Therefore , it is interesting to ask about the compressibility of i . i . not considered in that analysis . In this direction , we highlight the work of al . , which under an alternative notion of relative compressibility almost sure instead of convergence in measure , which was the criterion adopted in and a different analysis setting fixed rate instead of the variable rate used in , an exact dichotomy between compressible and non compressible i . i .

To address this question , we extend the analysis from i . i .. to stationary and ergodic . In this setting , the main result Theorem a necessary and sufficient condition for a stationary and ergodic process to be compressible in the sense of Amini al . , for any arbitrary . Furthermore , for the case of non compressible ergodic , we provide a closed form expression for an achievable rate approximation error function . The key element in the proof is the application of the ergodic theorem and the derivation of intermediate almost sure convergence Lemma and in Section that match and extend the approximation result by al . , Prop . for the i . i .. case . A corollary of Theorem a necessary and sufficient condition to categorize i . i .. random in of compressibility , which the analysis in and . In addition , for the class of non compressible ergodic , we provide an analysis of its rate approximation error curve that is continuous , differentiable Theorem and is convex under some Theorem .

Finally , Section an interplay between compressibility and compressed . Some of the and are in the Appendix . denote the norm of the best term approximation of , where by definition . In addition , the best term approximation error of , in the sense that if is the collection of sparse , then . For the analysis of infinite , Amini al . and al . have the following relative best term distortion indicator : with the objective of extending of compressibility to that have infinite norm . Definition : For a sequence , the rate distortion pair is if , there sequence of positive such that and Note that the use of the relative best term distortion in the analysis of with infinite norm . Definition : For a sequence and , we define its rate distortion approximation function by Proposition : For all such that then . The proof is in Appendix A Hence , can be seen as the critical asymptotic rate of innovation of when a relative best term approximation error of magnitude is . Alternatively , Amini , and have a notion of critical dimension for finite length , and from this , a notion of compressibility for infinite . We revisit those here : This notion of compressibility that when the block length to infinity , a negligible fraction of the is to represent with an arbitrary small distortion in the sense of . Note that is signal dependent and a variable rate sequence . In addition , it the critical number of to achieve a best term approximation error smaller or equal to in the sense of . From this , it should be related with the critical rate from a fixed rate analysis in Definition . That relationship is in the following result result : . In particular from Lemma , if is compressible , then for all . We refer the interested reader to Amini al . for further discussion and of compressible .. Rate of Innovation . Distortion for Random Analogous of rate of innovation . best term distortion and compressibility can be stated for the case of random or . Let be a random sequence with in and by its consistent family of finite dimensional , where and the space of probability for the measurable space . As a short hand , we denote by the process distribution of where the equality is by . Then in analogy with Definition , Amini al . the following : Definition : and Let be a random sequence with . Then for any and is the critical number of that the set typical with respect to . The process and , respectively is said to be compressible , if Definition : Let be a process by , and let us consider , and . We say that the rate distortion pair , is achievable for with Definition : The rate . best term approximation error function of in short the rate approximation error function of with probability is given by : A simple relationship between and the critical number of in can be established in the asymptotic regime when goes to infinity , showing that our fixed rate concept is a one . In the next section , we will study the class of stationary and ergodic , where the best term approximation measured in of will be in closed form . Furthermore , it will be shown for this class of random that Let be a stationary and ergodic process with distribution , where its marginal shift invariant distribution . For simplicity , we assume that where the measure . Theorem : Let be a stationary and ergodic process with shift invariant distribution such that . Then for any , we have the following dichotomy : If : then is not compressible . Furthermore , if we introduce the induced probability measure in by : : Theorem a necessary and sufficient condition for a stationary and ergodic process to be compressible in the sense in Definition . achievable rate distortion region for the process , given by the set of critical rate distortion : This region solely on the shift invariant measure and its induced measure in . More on the characterization of this region will be in Section . are achievable see proof in Section and more in Section . This fact is used to derive a concrete analytical expression for in . Furthermore , from the characterization in and , it can be shown that is a continuous and differentiable function with respect to see Theorem in Section . : In both i and , the critical a stationary and ergodic process is independent of . The reason is that asymptotically as goes to infinity , the characterization of to compute on that belong to the tail field of the process , which is known to be trivial i . e ., their have zero or one probability for the case of ergodic , , . Therefore , we obtain almost sure convergence that make independent of the value of our object of interest see Section for . : A natural order among stationary and ergodic process can be established from Theorem . Proposition : If is compressible for some , then is compressible for all . : the i . i .. scenario , we want to highlight the by Amini al . related to compressibility in the sense of . In particular , , Theorem that if is such that for some , then the i . i .. process is not compressible . In contrast , , Theorem that if to the domain of attraction of an stable distribution , Chap . . with , then the process is compressible . First for , Theorem a refined result , revealing a indeed , the complete family of i . i .. that are not compressible . In fact , in addition to that go to zero exponentially , and consequently , Gamma , heavy tail whose density function are tail lower and upper dominated by a power law decay of the form with are not compressible either . On the other hand , concerning , Th . , it is simple to verify that any that is in the domain of attraction of an stable law with that see Appendix E for , and consequently , part i of Theorem this family of compressible i . i . Therefore , stationary and ergodic with a shift invariant distribution that a , generalized , and Gamma are not compressible in the sense of Definition , for any . In addition , if is finitely , i . e ., where , then its process is not compressible for any . Corollary : Let be a ergodic process with invariant distribution and density If as for some , then Therefore , for shift invariant by a power tail behavior , which belong to the category of heavy tail , a complete picture of the range in which its ergodic process is compressible is . : For the proof of Theorem , we derive almost sure convergence see Lemma and in Section . Furthermore , for for some , it that In the case when : if , then and extend the result by al . , Prop . , which for the i . i .. case the same almost sure convergence limit for the object . Their proof was based on the lemma of order statistics see in , Th . . In contrast , our proof is based on the use of the tail in , some induced empirical on those , and the convergence of those empirical through the application of the ergodic theory see Section for . The idea adopted in our proof was to look at the empirical of and as the of interest , instead of the partial A measure is tail lower and upper dominated by a no negative function , if there and such that for any such that then . Here the of . Fig . . Graphical representation of the relationship between , and in Theorem . Notice that is the total area under the bottom curve . of the ordered statistics considered in , . That difference was essential to extend the almost sure convergence in Lemma and to the family of stationary and ergodic respectively . The numerator in the last expression to the value of , for a random variable where . Similarly , from , the optimal rate the value of . Thus , to the area under the tail of , which the of , in Fig . top , while with the area under the curve to the left of , in Fig . below . This graphical representation for an intuitive interpretation of the relationship between and the compressibility of a given stationary ergodic process . In order for this process to be compressible , must be zero for every and for every . Equivalently , and from that is a limit , it must be possible to achieve any while keeping an arbitrarily small fraction of the of the process , as . Such requirement is satisfied if and only if i . e ., if , which that no matter how large is chosen , the shaded area in Fig . bottom , being infinite , will yield a zero . The second almost sure convergence is from the assumption that . Then , we can state the following : Lemma : Let be a stationary and ergodic process with distribution and . Then for any and sequence such that almost surely to a distortion strictly less than , and then for all : Hence from the definition of in , we have that eventually in , which that The first inequality comes from Proposition and the last equality from the fact that the function is continuous with respect to as . Lemma : Let be a stationary and ergodic process with distribution and . Let us consider an arbitrary and such that , and therefore eventually in . From this , for all , which the result from Proposition . Proof : To begin let us prove the fixed rate result in . It is first important to concentrate in the case when and to show that Let us take an arbitrary . From the assumption on , the definition of and the fact that the same for the sequence and accordingly , we have from that with this result , for an arbitrary let us consider such that . We know that there such that , and for this we consider Furthermore , from definition of ordered , it is simple to verify that see : This is where the zero rate result in is used . In particular , if we consider , from , and the fact that is in the last equality in from definition of in . Finally from b and c , let be such that . Let us consider an arbitrary where and consequently note that and are mutually absolutely continuous . Again for this , we use the in , The first equality from the continuity of the function with respect to as . Then from the fact that , we have that a .. Finally , proving that a .. an equivalent symmetric argument and we omit it . and , we have that from and . Let us fix an arbitrary . Considering that , then eventually in , and therefore eventually , which from definition of that . Finally , the fact the event almost surely the result .. OF THE RATE APPROXIMATION ERROR CURVE FOR NON COMPRESSIBLE For the family of non compressible ergodic , in this section we study two tail that characterize the achievable rate distortion region in . Let be stationary and ergodic with its invariant probability measure . Here we focus on the case where , then the measure in is well defined and by construction , where the Radon derivative or density of with respect to is given by for all . Furthermore , from the strict positivity of all the in , and any distortion is in with a given rate . In summary , the rate distortion approximation function is continuous , and all the , in the sense that for any there is only one such that . In addition , it is strictly decreasing and the following boundary : and . Furthermore , it is simple to verify that and should be a non increasing function as progress to considering that , and consequently , should present a convex behavior eventually as to . The next section the convexity of more formally . First in this section we show that is a convex function of . Then , we provide a necessary and sufficient condition for to be a convex function of . Theorem : Let by a non compressible stationary and ergodic sequence with . Then Remark : The condition in is implicit and may be difficult to verify . A simple to check sufficient condition for the convexity of is the following : where . In particular , a non increasing i . e ., almost everywhere in a convex rate approximation error function . We present few of rate approximation error of non compressible i . i . In particular following , we consider the exponentially distribution , which is non compressible for any , from Corollary , and the family of Student distribution with parameter , whose goes to cero as . From Corollary , the i . i .. process with a Student distribution is compressible for any and non compressible for , for all . For this we consider an estimation approach . Considering a sufficiently large set of i . i .. of let say , the law of large us that for any and , The of a Student distribution with of freedom is given by , where is the gamma function . Fig . . Numerically rate approximation error for several non compressible i . i .. and one compressible i . i .. process . the use of . Then , by sampling the space of and considering a sufficiently large , we can estimate with an arbitrary good precision the rate distortion region . Following this path , Fig . the rate approximation error for the , and several Student distribution for . We verify that some Student distribution are compressible and and are non compressible , and as the Theorem . More interesting is to validate in all the of non compressible , that the have a convex behavior , which is from . Furthermore , the density with the exponentially tail is less compressible than any prior with a power law decay , in the sense that for a distortion the i . i .. process needs a higher rate . From these , as goes to infinity the i . i .. process with a heavy tail distribution the approximation error behavior of the law . Fig . the rate approximation error for the prior for different of . It is interesting to observe the increasing monotonic behavior of as , for any fixed value of . Again all have a convex behavior . To contrast , Fig . a set of for the distribution i . e ., Student distribution with We conclude this work compressible stationary and ergodic , as in Theorem , in of their ability to be with an arbitrary small proportion of linear for that the classical compressed measurement and reconstruction setting . In particular , the focus is on compressible , as the standard i . i .. linear acquisition and minimization sparsity of , offer a well known instance guarantee stated below in Lemma that the modeling assumption of compressible . is a linear operator , that given a signal a measurement vector . The case of interest is on the under regime , i . e . where under sparse or compressible on , can offer perfect or near optimal reconstruction by the solution of the following linear problem : Notably , the theory , based on the restricted isometry property RIP , sufficient over and implicitly over the number of in order that , when for some . The next result , in its original form stated in , that random offer a solution to that problem with a near optimal relationship between and . Lemma : , Th . . and , Th . . Let be a random matrix whose are driven by i . i . of a distribution or a binary variable with uniform distribution over . For any arbitrary and , we have that : with a probability , over the sampling space , at least equal to . Here is the solution of The proof of this result directly from , Th . . and , Th . . Here we formalize the reconstruction of infinite . For this , we consider a finite length or fixed rate approach , where the idea is to analyze consecutive finite block of the sequence , i . e ., to sense and reconstruct for any , and study reconstruction in the limit when the block length to infinity . More precisely , let be a sequence of positive such that . From this sequence , we consider the family of where for any , is the random matrix of by i . i .. as in Lemma , and is the function from to that the minimization problem in . Given a sequence and any finite block length , we can apply the approach over to recover , which is a random reconstruction function of the matrix . In relation with the relative approximation error in , we consider as a fidelity indicator the noise to signal ratio given by : More generally , if we have a process with distribution and a sequence of with its associated finite block scheme , we can also analyze the finite block performance of the scheme by the object of two independent random : the vector and the random matrix . Therefore , it is important to consider the average with respect to the statistics of the source i . e ., Then the question we focus here is : for an compressible process that , what is the minimum rate of i . e . or more generally with probability one with respect to the statistics of the sequence of random matrices From Theorem and the RIP based instance result of the setting in Lemma , we can state the following result : Theorem : Let be a stationary ergodic process . If is compressible , then for any sequence such : This result that in order to achieve zero distortion in the reconstruction for an compressible process , almost surely in the sense of , the scheme needs an arbitrary small number of per sample . In other , under the compressibility model assumption for the process , the minimum rate to achieve zero distortion is zero for the scheme . Then , it is remarkable to validate that is able to achieve the same zero critical rate that it is by the analysis of the pure oracle best term approximation error of compressible process see the result in Lemma . : This result that the lucid notion of compressibility by Amini al . really in a meaningful performance result for the classical setting in the asymptotic regime when the goes to infinity . In other , we can say that compressibility , meaning a sort of zero rate of innovation in the process , zero rate of per signal dimension for perfect recovery in the sense of distortion for the scheme . This result a gap not in between their notion of compressibility and performance guarantee in the asymptotic regime . : Concerning compressibility of random and performance guarantee , we want to highlight the work of al . for the case of i . i . They show in , Theorem that if then of Theorem for the i . i .. case , Remark . Then , we want to give credit to this contribution to be the first result that a connection between of compressibility for i . i .. based on relative approximation and the performance in the asymptotic regime of the classical scheme . In this context , Theorem can be seen as an extension of these to the case of stationary and ergodic and , in the technical side , an extension on the use of the instance property of the minimization . On the other hand , on the i . i .. context , and offer a way to verify that Amini al . compressible notion variable rate in nature a connection with the in al . , Th . and . in of what can for the case of compressible . The main result of this work Theorem a connection between al . , Prop . almost sure convergence result of relative approximation , and Amini al . notion of compressibility for random . More importantly , Theorem new to extend that connection and , consequently , a dichotomy between being and non being compressible random to the family of stationary and ergodic . This extension is over the almost sure convergence of the empirical of and , respectively see in the statement of Theorem to the true on the family of tail in Section . The idea of looking at specific empirical as the basic object of interest , in b and c , instead of the statistics of the sum of the ordered sequence as considered in , Prop . and , was essential to extend the analysis from the i . i .. case to the case of stationary ergodic . Finally , one can notice from the proof of Theorem that this result does not rely on a stationary property , as it is essentially over the family of indicator of the tail in . Then , we conjecture that the analysis of compressible can be extended over a family of random with a specific ergodic property over the tail , which is an interesting direction for future work . This observation us to put the attention on the general theory of non stationary with ergodic , , . Point : of all and in : Proposition and and the hypothesis that in . Then , Proposition e , we have that all the and in the range . First , it is important to verify that the implicit characterization of in and a well defined function . By contradiction , let assume that such characterization is not a function in the sense that for a given distortion there are two solution of associated to two different . This last condition that from , which the fact that and are of . Moving to the continuity , let us fix an arbitrary and . Then by the of the , such that . On the other hand , by the of the , there , where and without loss of generality we assume that . Then from of we have that for any , we have by the of the function that there such that , and consequently , First , it is clear that both and are differentiable by construction . In fact from Furthermore , we can introduce the auxiliary function that is differentiable , and Proof : Considering that , let be its . In view of Theorem , for a fixed , there such that can be expressed as : , the middle term in is negative and with , proving the convexity for that case . For the case , from the right hand side of convexity will hold , if and only if , Proof : Let fix and . Assuming that is compressible , from Theorem we have that and , consequently , it that : this inequality is valid with probability over sampling space of the random object . There , which is valid for any arbitrary small and . In other , if we define the set , we need a slightly different argument . Under the assumption that , it is simple to verify that there a sequence of positive such that and , more importantly , it that from the Lemma and the fact that as by hypothesis . Following similar than before , there such that we have that , and therefore , from Lemma , with probability in . It is important to define the set where Lemma us that . Furthermore , from with probability one with respect to the process distribution of . In other , if we define the set where it is simple to show that , by and the of and . Hence , the problem to evaluate , the last equality from the fact that . Then from the additivity and monotony of the measure , which the result by the definition of . and . Consequently eventually in which that eventually . This the result . For the other inequality , we consider the case when . We prove it by contradiction assuming that . Then from , there and a sequence such that . Under the fact that , there such that this and the definition of in This approach can be a finite number of times independent of the length Proof : the to prove Theorem Point , if we consider , then for any there such that . This last auxiliary function is with respect to and we have that : with , it that is negative and increasing with , i . e ., is a convex function of . The family of stable is the class of non degenerate that are limit in distribution of of random of the form : where are i . i . of a random variable , and and are a of real . For the scenario when , the Central Limit Theorem us that the limit is a normal law . For the case , we have the less known family of stable , whose characteristic function is given by , Th . . : Definition : . The distribution is said to be in the domain of attraction of an stable law with , which we denote by , if there and such that : in distribution and the stable distribution in . Proof : Let and . Without loss of generality let us assume that is slowly . Then it is simple to verify that , and such ﻿ This paper novel on scalar feedback quantization with uniform . We focus on general where reconstruction is via a linear combination of frame . a deterministic approach , we derive two necessary and sufficient for to be optimal , i . e ., to produce , for every input , a sequence that is a global minimizer of the norm of the reconstruction error . The first condition is related to the design of the feedback , and can always be . The second condition only on the reconstruction , and is given explicitly in of the Gram matrix of the reconstruction frame . As a by product , we also show that the the first condition alone scalar feedback that yield the , when one quantization noise as uncorrelated , identically distributed random . In many signal , have to be by a series of , so that they can be , or in digital form . This paradigm sampling , quantization and reconstruction . The quantization of the , namely the sequence ,, a sequence whose are constrained to belong to a discrete set of . We focus our attention on uniform quantization , and thus require that The and most common paradigm to recover the signal from the is linear reconstruction . Here , one is able to recover the original signal , say a , via In , is a set of a frame in the reconstruction space typically a subspace of or of L . Thus , the are the frame expansion of a . of linear reconstruction are the reconstruction formula , the reconstruction stage in filter , and the inverse wavelet transform . Throughout this work , we will be concerned with the squared norm of the reconstruction error , i . e ., for every . Unfortunately , minimization of subject to is a non convex optimization problem . Moreover , the complexity of this problem exponentially with the number of to be . In addition , unless an orthogonal set , one would need to preview the entire input sequence before being able to calculate any optimal value for . This is incompatible with delay sensitive . For the above , in practice quantization is often accomplished via simpler sub optimal that operate sequentially . The of these correspond to scalar feedback . At the i th iteration , these A obtain the output sample by simple scalar quantization of an auxiliary sequence , which is a linear combination of input and output , i . e ., In , the real ai ,, i , , ,..., are design , and is the nearest scalar quantization function The above can be used to describe many scalar quantization and bit Sigma Delta . The latter have been well studied in the context of shift invariant reconstruction wherein reconstruction is done by , and recently also for frame see , e .., , . Not surprisingly , for a given reconstruction frame , and in return for the above , optimal vector quantization generally . However , it is not known under what this performance gap . In this paper we derive those . More precisely , we state necessary and sufficient for to be optimal , i . e ., to yield , for any input , the output sequence that , in . Our extend the work in , to more general . Notation We use bold , e .., to denote both the sequence and the column vector x , where the meaning is clear from the context .

Thus , i can always be satisfied by a proper choice of which is given explicitly by . On the other hand , condition only on the reconstruction frame , or more precisely , on its Gram matrix . The proof of Theorem will be given in Section , based on preliminary given in and . The latter provide valuable insight into the problem , and stem from two alternative : lattice quantization and dynamic . In this section we use the fact that minimization of subject to is equivalent to a lattice quantization problem . To show this , we first note that any symmetric positive semidefinite matrix can be decomposed as where is lower triangular see ., e .., . It then directly from and that . Thus , one can analyze the relationship between the of any group of by looking at their in through . In particular , Since the quantization alphabet U is uniform see , the all the UN constitute the reconstruction lattice Accordingly , we say that is the generating matrix for . Every lattice a basic cell , V , associated with it , i . e ., the region of closer to the origin than to any other point in the lattice . More precisely Similarly , we define the quantization cell around of an converter as where the hyper cube : , , is the set all possible quantization noise . Thus , is the set of all target for which an the sequence . With the above , we can now prove the necessity of condition i of Theorem . Lemma For a reconstruction frame with gram matrix , the distortion , u of an can equal for all only if condition i in Theorem . is that it the minimum second moment among all the whose form a tessellation , see . Thus , an is a candidate to be optimal only if its second moment N . This second moment can be readily shown to be given by trace I I , lower triangular lower strictly triangular . The fact that each trace term only on its corresponding column the trace is each i i i . where i is an arbitrary vector in Hi and , thus , in as well . Substitution of the identity A † † AT into , thus the proof . Remark If a vector of uncorrelated , uniformly distributed u . u ., random , one trace trace I I . On the other hand , an whose feedback matrix to characterize one of the noise shaping for frame in . More precisely , condition i is satisfied by the variant in which the error associated with each coefficient is onto all the ahead of the current iteration coefficient . Thus , Lemma also that , an u . u . model for quantization , the latter scheme the minimum among all . Sequential quantization , such as , decide upon the value of each output coefficient sequentially . Insight can be by them from a dynamic point of view . The key point is that each of the additively to the cost defined in , leaving , after each step , a sub problem similar in form to the original one . In turn , each of these sub is determined by the already made . The following result us to formalize these Proof The result from direct algebraic manipulation , the identity A † AA † A † and from the fact that † , i ,..., which positive semidefinite . Recursive application of Lemma to one to split the total cost , as : The summation on the right hand side of the irreducible reconstruction error stemming from the first i . The cost to go after decision i is the last term in . It the same form as the original cost , but it the target vector . The latter can be as a state vector which the effect of , and of previous , on the go . Joint Sufficiency of i and It is well known in lattice theory that any two L and L , with M and M non singular , are equal there an integral such that M see , e .., . On the other hand , if i and hold , then there a lower matrix such that is integral . lower unit triangular , we have that , and thus . It then that . On the other hand , if condition i , then it directly from that the product an orthogonal , lower triangular matrix . This in turn a rectangular lattice . Moreover , it is easy to verify that the associated cell V is given by the hyper rectangle , which is precisely the quantization cell of the , N see . Therefore i and guarantee that the corresponding is optimal . Necessity of i and The necessity of i was shown in Lemma . Thus , it to prove the necessity of assuming that i . If i , then the target given in can be written in of the feedback Now let us consider a that the target vector , at iteration i , for some UN i and some e ,. With the above target , an would choose ti , i , and thus . Then , from , the cost to go for the after i can be split as the minimum difference between the cost to go achievable by and that of the choice is that . As a consequence , the first term on the right hand side of is strictly positive . It then that , u is strictly than , for sufficiently small of e , the proof . Lattice Quantization Interpretation It been shown in the proof of Theorem that is a sufficient condition be rectangular and have a hyper rectangular cell . It is important to note that this can happen for a non diagonal reconstruction Gram matrix , i . e ., reconstruction that are non orthogonal , and even linearly dependent , not to be non singular . It is also important to note that the converse does not necessarily hold , that is , a not ensure that condition is satisfied . More precisely , the fact that a lattice is rectangular the existence of an integral such that is orthogonal . It be also lower unit triangular , as by . On the other hand , i alone is orthogonal , and thus N is . For a uniformly distributed , the gap between such an and a lattice vector is given by the difference between the second of N and V . Although no closed from are known for the second moment of V of arbitrary , preliminary suggest that it is possible to derive lower for this gap from the non integer part of the mi defined in b . Reconstruction by a Single Filter By and considering the distortion per sample , as the cost function , our can be applied to where reconstruction is a discrete time filter , say . Without loss of generality , we assume that . In this case , the reconstruction frame take the form , where is the impulse response of . This setup infinite dimensional matrices , the first column . In turn , f can be seen as the impulse response of a filter . It then that the orthogonality of the of stemming from i is equivalent to . This to a whitening , which minimum , in the alternative white quantization noise paradigm . Similarly , an satisfying i also the , see Remark . On the other hand , for this case , all the mi see b are equal to the impulse response first sample removed of . Thus , into the impulse response of being integer valued . Hence , the standard th order bit converter is optimal for . This the in , for U , . We derived necessary and sufficient that make scalar feedback quantization optimal , in the sense of generating , for any input , the sequence that the norm of the reconstruction error . The first condition , which only on the design of the scalar feedback , to characterize the best of this class , when a stochastic framework is adopted . The second condition only on the Gram matrix of the reconstruction frame , and can be satisfied for non orthogonal , and even linearly dependent , reconstruction .
